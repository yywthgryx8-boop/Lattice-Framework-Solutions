# Lattice-Framework-Solutions
Practical Python examples demonstrating how structured constraints, mode routing, and feedback layers can shape large-language-model behavior at inference time—without modifying model weights. This repository contains self-contained demos focused on safety gating, adaptive response modes, and symbolic control patterns for human-AI workflows.
